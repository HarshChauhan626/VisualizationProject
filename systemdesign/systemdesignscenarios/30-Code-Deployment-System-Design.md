- **Build Automation**: Automated building, testing, and packaging of applications
- **Deployment Orchestration**: Coordinate deployments across multiple environments
- **Environment Management**: Manage development, staging, and production environments
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Quick rollback to previous stable versions
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployment strategies
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Manage infrastructure through code and automation
- **Security Scanning**: Automated security and vulnerability scanning
- **Approval Workflows**: Multi-stage approval processes for production deployments
- **Monitoring Integration**: Integration with monitoring and observability tools

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime for deployment services
- **Performance**: <5 minutes for typical application deployments
- **Scalability**: Support 10K+ applications and 100K+ deployments per day
- **Security**: Secure handling of secrets, credentials, and deployment artifacts
- **Auditability**: Complete audit trails for all deployments and changes
- **Reliability**: 99.9% deployment success rate with automatic failure recovery

### Key Constraints
- Support multiple programming languages and frameworks
- Handle complex deployment dependencies and ordering
- Manage secrets and sensitive configuration securely
- Support hybrid and multi-cloud deployment scenarios
- Maintain compliance with security and regulatory requirements

### Success Metrics
- 99.99% availability for deployment pipeline services
- <10 minutes average deployment time for production releases
- >99% deployment success rate with automated rollback
- <2 minutes mean time to detect deployment failures
- Support 1K+ concurrent deployment pipelines
