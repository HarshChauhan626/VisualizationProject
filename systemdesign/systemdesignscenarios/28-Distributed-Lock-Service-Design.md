# Distributed Lock Service System Design Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary & Requirements

### System Overview
A high-availability distributed lock service that provides mutual exclusion and coordination primitives for distributed systems. The service ensures that only one process can hold a lock at any given time, handles lock expiration, and provides strong consistency guarantees across a distributed infrastructure similar to Apache Zookeeper or etcd.

### Functional Requirements
- **Lock Acquisition**: Acquire exclusive locks with configurable timeout
- **Lock Release**: Release locks explicitly or through automatic expiration
- **Lock Renewal**: Extend lock duration for long-running operations
- **Blocking Locks**: Wait for lock availability with configurable timeout
- **Non-blocking Locks**: Try-lock operations with immediate response
- **Lock Queuing**: Fair queuing for lock acquisition requests
- **Lock Monitoring**: Monitor lock status and ownership
- **Deadlock Detection**: Detect and resolve potential deadlock situations
- **Lock Hierarchies**: Support hierarchical locking with parent-child relationships
- **Lock Statistics**: Detailed metrics and analytics on lock usage

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime with automatic failover
- **Consistency**: Strong consistency for lock state across all nodes
- **Latency**: <10ms for lock acquisition, <5ms for lock release
- **Throughput**: Handle 100K+ lock operations per second
- **Durability**: Persist lock state with replication across multiple nodes
- **Scalability**: Support 1M+ concurrent locks across distributed systems

### Key Constraints
- Handle network partitions and node failures gracefully
- Prevent split-brain scenarios in distributed environments
- Support both short-lived and long-lived lock operations
- Maintain lock ordering and fairness guarantees
- Handle clock skew and time synchronization issues

### Success Metrics
- 99.99% availability for lock operations
- <5ms P95 latency for lock acquisition
- Zero lock state inconsistencies across nodes
- 100% deadlock detection and resolution
- Support 10K+ concurrent clients per cluster
