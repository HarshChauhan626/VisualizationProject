## 🔧 Core Microservices Architecture

**The Birthplace of Modern Microservices:**
Amazon pioneered the microservices architecture transformation, evolving from a monolithic bookstore application to **800+ independent microservices** that power the world's largest e-commerce platform. This architectural revolution enabled Amazon to scale from thousands to **300+ million customers** while maintaining system reliability and enabling rapid feature development.

**Microservices Transformation Strategy:**

**1. Monolith Decomposition Approach:**
- **Domain-Driven Decomposition**: Services aligned with business domains (catalog, orders, payments, inventory)
- **Strangler Fig Pattern**: Gradually extracted services from monolith without disrupting operations
- **Data Ownership**: Each service owns its data store, eliminating shared database dependencies
- **API-First Design**: All inter-service communication through well-defined REST APIs
- **Independent Deployment**: Teams deploy services independently without coordinating releases

**2. Service Communication Architecture:**
- **Synchronous Communication**: REST APIs for real-time operations (search, checkout, payments)
- **Asynchronous Messaging**: SQS and SNS for event-driven workflows (order processing, inventory updates)
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Services publish events for state changes, enabling loose coupling
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascade failures when downstream services are unavailable
- **Retry and Timeout Strategies**: Resilient communication patterns for distributed systems

**3. Data Management Strategy:**
- **Polyglot Persistence**: Different databases optimized for specific use cases
- **DynamoDB**: Product catalog, user sessions, shopping cart data for high-speed access
- **RDS MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Transactional data (orders, payments, user accounts) requiring ACID properties
- **ElasticSearch**: Product search, recommendations, analytics with full-text search capabilities
- **S3**: Product images, documents, static content with global CDN distribution
- **Redshift**: Data warehousing for business intelligence and analytics

**4. Service Ownership Model:**
- **Two-Pizza Teams**: Small, autonomous teams (6-8 people) own complete services
- **Full-Stack Ownership**: Teams responsible for development, testing, deployment, and operations
- **DevOps Culture**: "You build it, you run it" philosophy promotes ownership and reliability
- **Service Level Agreements**: Clear contracts between services with defined performance expectations
- **Continuous Deployment**: Multiple deployments per day with automated testing and rollback

### 1. Product Catalog Service
