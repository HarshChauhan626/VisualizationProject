**AI-Powered Personalization Engine:**
The personalization system adapts content and learning paths based on individual student behavior and performance.

```java
@Service
public class PersonalizationService {
    
    public LearningPath generatePersonalizedPath(String studentId, String courseId) {
        StudentProfile profile = getStudentProfile(studentId);
        CourseContent content = getCourseContent(courseId);
        
        // AI-powered path generation
        PersonalizationRequest request = PersonalizationRequest.builder()
            .studentProfile(profile)
            .courseContent(content)
            .learningObjectives(content.getObjectives())
            .build();
            
        return aiRecommendationService.generateLearningPath(request);
    }
}
```
