- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime during market hours
- **Consistency**: Strong consistency for order matching and settlement
- **Compliance**: SOX, MiFID II, Dodd-Frank regulatory compliance
- **Security**: Multi-layered security with encryption and access controls

### Key Constraints
- Strict regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions
- Ultra-low latency requirements for high-frequency trading
- Handle market volatility and sudden volume spikes
- Maintain audit trails for all transactions
- Support multiple trading venues and dark pools

### Success Metrics
- <500μs average order-to-execution latency

## 5. Detailed Component Design

### 5.1 Matching Engine

**Purpose & Responsibilities:**
- Execute order matching with price-time priority algorithm
- Maintain real-time order books for all tradable instruments
- Handle different order types (market, limit, stop, iceberg)
- Ensure fair and transparent order execution
- Support high-frequency trading requirements

**Matching Algorithms:**
- **Price-Time Priority**: Orders matched by best price, then time priority
- **Pro-Rata**: Proportional allocation for same-price orders
- **Size Priority**: Larger orders get priority at same price level
- **Hidden Liquidity**: Support for iceberg and hidden orders
- **Auction Matching**: Opening and closing auction algorithms

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **In-Memory Order Books**: Keep active order books in memory
- **Lock-Free Data Structures**: Minimize contention in multi-threaded environment
- **CPU Affinity**: Pin critical processes to specific CPU cores
- **NUMA Optimization**: Optimize memory access patterns
- **Zero-Copy Operations**: Minimize memory copying for performance

### 5.2 Risk Management Engine

**Purpose & Responsibilities:**
- Real-time risk assessment for all trading activities
- Monitor position limits, concentration limits, and leverage

- Generate risk reports and alerts for compliance

**Risk Controls:**
- **Pre-trade Checks**: Order size, price, and position limits
- **Post-trade Monitoring**: Real-time P&L and risk metric tracking
- **Margin Management**: Initial and maintenance margin calculations
- **Stress Testing**: Scenario analysis and stress testing
- **Regulatory Limits**: Compliance with position and exposure limits

**Risk Metrics:**
- **Value-at-Risk (VaR)**: Statistical measure of potential losses
- **Expected Shortfall**: Average loss beyond VaR threshold
- **Greeks**: Delta, gamma, theta, vega for derivatives
- **Concentration Risk**: Exposure concentration by sector/instrument
- **Liquidity Risk**: Assessment of position liquidity

### 5.3 Market Data Engine

**Purpose & Responsibilities:**
- Process real-time market data feeds from multiple sources
- Maintain consolidated order books and market data
- Distribute market data to internal systems and external clients
- Handle market data normalization and conflation
- Ensure data quality and completeness

**Data Processing:**
- **Feed Handlers**: Protocol-specific handlers for different data sources
- **Message Sequencing**: Ensure proper message ordering and gap detection
- **Data Normalization**: Convert data to standard internal formats
- **Conflation**: Combine multiple updates into single messages
- **Quality Assurance**: Validate data integrity and completeness
