# Food Delivery System Design Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary & Requirements

### System Overview
A comprehensive food delivery platform that connects customers, restaurants, and delivery drivers, facilitating food ordering, real-time tracking, and efficient delivery logistics. The system handles millions of orders with real-time location tracking, dynamic pricing, and multi-party coordination similar to DoorDash or Uber Eats.

### Functional Requirements
- **Restaurant Management**: Restaurant profiles, menus, availability, and order management
- **Customer Ordering**: Browse restaurants, customize orders, and track deliveries
- **Driver Management**: Driver onboarding, order assignment, and earnings tracking
- **Real-time Tracking**: Live location tracking for customers and drivers
- **Order Management**: End-to-end order lifecycle from placement to delivery
- **Payment Processing**: Multi-party payments with driver commissions and restaurant payouts
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Surge pricing based on demand, distance, and availability
- **Ratings & Reviews**: Multi-party rating system for restaurants, drivers, and customers
- **Promotional System**: Discounts, coupons, and loyalty programs
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Business intelligence for all stakeholders

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime during peak meal times
- **Latency**: <2 seconds for order placement, <1 second for location updates
- **Scale**: 1M+ orders per day, 100K+ concurrent users during peak hours
- **Throughput**: 10K+ orders per minute during peak times
- **Accuracy**: <50m location accuracy, >95% successful order completion
- **Real-time**: Sub-second location updates and order status changes

### Key Constraints
- Handle peak meal time traffic spikes (lunch and dinner rushes)
- Coordinate three different user types with conflicting interests
- Ensure food safety and delivery time constraints
- Manage complex logistics with dynamic driver allocation

### Success Metrics
- 99.99% availability during peak hours
- <30 minutes average delivery time
- >4.5 average platform rating across all parties
- <2% order cancellation rate
- Support 50+ cities with localized operations
