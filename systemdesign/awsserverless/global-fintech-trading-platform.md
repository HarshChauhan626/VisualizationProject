```java
// Market Data Processing Stream
StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();
KStream<String, MarketData> marketDataStream = builder.stream("market-data");

marketDataStream
    .filter((key, value) -> value.getPrice() > 0)
    .groupByKey()
    .windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(Duration.ofMillis(100)))
    .aggregate(
        () -> new PriceAggregate(),
        (key, value, aggregate) -> aggregate.update(value),
        Materialized.as("price-aggregates")
    )
    .toStream()
    .to("aggregated-prices");
```

## 13. High-Frequency Trading Architecture Deep Dive

The high-frequency trading (HFT) architecture implements ultra-low latency optimizations across the entire stack, from network hardware to application code. The system achieves sub-100 microsecond order execution through specialized infrastructure and software optimizations.

**Low-Latency Infrastructure:**
```yaml
# Dedicated HFT Node Group
hftNodeGroup:
  instanceTypes: ["c6in.8xlarge"]
  placementGroup:
    name: "hft-cluster"
    strategy: "cluster"
  enhancedNetworking: true
  sriovNetSupport: true
  ebsOptimized: true
  nodeLabels:
    trading-type: "hft"
    latency: "ultra-low"
  nodeTaints:
    - key: "hft"
      value: "dedicated"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
```

**Real-Time Risk Management System:**
The risk management system operates with microsecond latency to evaluate and approve trades before execution:

```java
// Real-Time Risk Calculator
@Component
public class RealTimeRiskCalculator {
    
    private final CircuitBreaker circuitBreaker;
    private final RiskCache riskCache;
    
    @Async
    public CompletableFuture<RiskDecision> calculateRisk(Order order) {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            // Position size validation
            Position currentPosition = riskCache.getPosition(order.getSymbol());
            if (currentPosition.getSize() + order.getQuantity() > getPositionLimit()) {
                return RiskDecision.REJECT;
            }
            
            // Real-time P&L calculation
            double unrealizedPnL = calculateUnrealizedPnL(currentPosition, getCurrentPrice());
            if (unrealizedPnL < getRiskTolerance()) {
                return RiskDecision.REJECT;
            }
            
            return RiskDecision.APPROVE;
        }, riskExecutor);
    }
}
```

**Market Data Ingestion Pipeline:**
High-frequency market data processing with specialized protocols and optimizations:

```yaml
# Market Data Processing Configuration
marketData:
  protocols:
    - name: "FIX"
      version: "4.4"
      multicast: true
      compression: false
    - name: "ITCH"
      version: "5.0"
      binary: true
      zerocopy: true
  processing:
    batchSize: 1000
    flushInterval: "100us"
    bufferSize: "64MB"
    cpuAffinity: [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Regulatory Reporting Automation:**
Automated compliance reporting with real-time transaction reporting and audit trails:

```java
// MiFID II Transaction Reporting
@Service
public class MiFIDReportingService {
    
    @EventListener
    public void handleTradeExecution(TradeExecutionEvent event) {
        TransactionReport report = TransactionReport.builder()
            .transactionReferenceNumber(event.getTradeId())
            .tradingVenue(event.getVenue())
            .instrumentIdentification(event.getInstrument())
            .buyerIdentification(event.getBuyer())
            .sellerIdentification(event.getSeller())
            .quantity(event.getQuantity())
            .price(event.getPrice())
            .tradingDateTime(event.getExecutionTime())
            .build();
            
        reportingClient.submitReport(report, Duration.ofMinutes(15));
    }
}
```

**Performance Monitoring for HFT:**
```yaml
# Ultra-Low Latency Metrics
prometheus:
  rules:
    - alert: OrderLatencyHigh
      expr: histogram_quantile(0.99, trading_order_latency_microseconds) > 100
