# DSA Cheatsheet Content Generation System Design

## Overview

This design document outlines the strategic approach for transforming existing empty markdown files in the `cheatsheettrickstips` folder into comprehensive Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) cheatsheets. The system will generate detailed reference materials covering seven core DSA topics: Arrays, Dynamic Programming, Geometry, Graphs, Queue & Stack, Strings, and Trees.

The cheatsheets serve as comprehensive interview preparation resources, providing theoretical foundations, practical applications, algorithmic approaches, and problem-solving strategies. Each cheatsheet will contain a minimum of 6,000 words, structured to support rapid knowledge acquisition and retention for technical interviews and competitive programming.

## Architecture

### Content Structure Framework

The cheatsheet system follows a standardized 10-section architecture designed for optimal learning and reference:
