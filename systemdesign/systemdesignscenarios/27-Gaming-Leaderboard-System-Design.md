# Gaming Leaderboard System Design Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary & Requirements

### System Overview
A high-performance gaming leaderboard system that tracks player scores, rankings, and achievements across multiple games with real-time updates, global and regional leaderboards, and social features. The system handles millions of players and score updates with low latency and high accuracy similar to systems used by major gaming platforms.

### Functional Requirements

- **Multi-Game Support**: Handle multiple games with different scoring systems
- **Time-based Leaderboards**: Daily, weekly, monthly, and all-time rankings
- **Regional Leaderboards**: Geographic and demographic-based rankings
- **Social Features**: Friends leaderboards and social comparisons
- **Achievement System**: Track and award achievements and badges
- **Historical Data**: Maintain score history and trend analysis
- **Anti-Cheat Protection**: Detect and prevent score manipulation
- **Leaderboard APIs**: RESTful APIs for game integration

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency**: <50ms for score updates, <100ms for leaderboard queries
- **Throughput**: Handle 1M+ score updates per second during peak times
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime for leaderboard services
- **Scalability**: Support 100M+ players across thousands of games
- **Consistency**: Strong consistency for score updates and rankings
- **Real-time**: <1 second for leaderboard position updates

### Key Constraints
- Handle score submission spikes during events and tournaments
- Maintain ranking accuracy during high-frequency updates
- Support various game genres with different scoring mechanics
- Prevent cheating and score manipulation attempts
- Scale across global player base with regional preferences

### Success Metrics
- 99.99% availability for score submission and leaderboard queries
- <25ms P95 latency for score updates
- >99.9% accuracy in leaderboard rankings
- Support 10K+ concurrent score updates per game
- Zero tolerance for fraudulent scores in rankings
