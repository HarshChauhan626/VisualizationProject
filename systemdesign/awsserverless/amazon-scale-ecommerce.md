## 2. Architecture Overview

Event-driven microservices handle catalog management, order processing, inventory synchronization, and personalized experiences across a globally distributed platform.

**Core Principles:**
- Domain-driven service boundaries (catalog, orders, inventory, customers)
- Event sourcing for audit trails and analytics
- CQRS for optimized read/write patterns
- Multi-layer caching for performance
- Search-first product discovery

**Primary AWS Services:**
- **API Gateway**: 1B+ daily API calls with intelligent caching
- **Lambda**: Business logic, transformations, integrations
- **DynamoDB**: Product catalog, customer data, orders
- **ElastiCache**: Product cache and customer sessions
- **Kinesis**: Customer interactions, inventory, order events
- **EventBridge**: Workflow orchestration
- **OpenSearch**: Product search and recommendations

```

## 5. Real-Time Processing

### Personalization Engine
**Real-Time Recommendations:**
1. Customer interaction captured via Kinesis
2. Stream processing analyzes behavioral patterns
3. Lambda calculates updated recommendation scores
4. ElastiCache refreshes recommendations
5. Next page load includes updates

**Data Sources:**
- Page views with dwell time
- Search queries and interactions
- Cart operations and purchase history
- Browsing patterns and preferences

### Inventory Management
**Real-Time Updates:**
