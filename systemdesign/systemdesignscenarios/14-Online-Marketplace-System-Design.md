# Online Marketplace System Design Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary & Requirements

### System Overview
A comprehensive online marketplace platform that connects buyers and sellers, facilitating product discovery, transactions, and fulfillment. The system handles millions of products, users, and transactions with advanced search, recommendation engines, and integrated payment processing similar to Amazon or eBay.

### Functional Requirements
- **Product Catalog**: Manage millions of products with rich metadata and media
- **User Management**: Buyer and seller accounts with profiles and preferences
- **Search & Discovery**: Advanced search with filters, facets, and recommendations
- **Shopping Cart**: Persistent cart across devices with saved items
- **Order Management**: End-to-end order processing and tracking
- **Payment Processing**: Multiple payment methods with fraud detection
- **Inventory Management**: Real-time inventory tracking and updates
- **Reviews & Ratings**: User-generated reviews and seller ratings
- **Seller Tools**: Seller dashboard, analytics, and inventory management
- **Customer Service**: Support ticket system and dispute resolution

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime with global distribution
- **Latency**: <200ms for search, <100ms for product pages
- **Scale**: 100M+ products, 10M+ active users, 1M+ orders per day
- **Throughput**: 10K+ concurrent users, 1K+ orders per minute
- **Consistency**: Strong consistency for orders and payments, eventual for catalog
- **Security**: PCI DSS compliance and fraud prevention

### Key Constraints
- Handle seasonal traffic spikes (Black Friday, holiday shopping)
- Maintain inventory accuracy across multiple sellers
- Ensure payment security and regulatory compliance
- Support international markets with different currencies and languages

### Success Metrics
- 99.99% availability during peak shopping periods
