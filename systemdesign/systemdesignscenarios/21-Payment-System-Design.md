The system supports real-time payment processing, fraud detection, compliance management, and multi-party settlements with high availability and strong consistency guarantees.

### Functional Requirements
- **Payment Processing**: Process various payment methods (credit cards, digital wallets, bank transfers)
- **Multi-currency Support**: Handle payments in multiple currencies with real-time exchange rates
- **Fraud Detection**: Real-time fraud screening and risk assessment
- **Compliance Management**: PCI DSS, AML, KYC, and regional regulatory compliance
- **Settlement Processing**: Multi-party settlements with configurable timing
- **Refunds & Chargebacks**: Handle payment reversals and dispute management
- **Recurring Payments**: Support subscription and scheduled payment processing
- **Payment Analytics**: Real-time reporting and business intelligence
- **Wallet Management**: Digital wallet creation and balance management
- **API Integration**: RESTful APIs for merchant and partner integration

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime for payment processing
- **Latency**: <200ms for payment authorization, <2 seconds for processing
- **Throughput**: Handle 100K+ transactions per second at peak
- **Consistency**: Strong consistency for financial transactions
- **Security**: PCI DSS Level 1 compliance and end-to-end encryption
- **Durability**: 99.999999999% transaction data durability

### Key Constraints
- Strict regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions
- Zero tolerance for financial data loss or corruption
- Real-time fraud detection without impacting user experience
- Support for legacy payment systems and modern payment methods
- Handle seasonal traffic spikes (Black Friday, holiday shopping)

### Success Metrics
- 99.99% payment processing availability
- <0.1% false positive rate for fraud detection
- >99% successful payment completion rate
- <1 second average payment processing time
- 100% PCI DSS compliance audit success

```

**Architectural Style Rationale**: Event-driven microservices with strong consistency chosen for:
- Independent scaling of different payment functions (processing, fraud, settlement)
- Strong consistency requirements for financial transactions
- Real-time processing capabilities for fraud detection and authorization
- Regulatory compliance through service isolation and audit trails
- Integration with multiple external payment systems and partners
