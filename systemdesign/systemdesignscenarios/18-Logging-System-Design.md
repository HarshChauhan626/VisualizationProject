- **Real-time Processing**: Process and index logs in real-time with minimal latency
- **Search & Analytics**: Powerful search capabilities with filters, aggregations, and visualizations
- **Alerting**: Real-time alerting based on log patterns and anomalies
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies with automated archival
- **Multi-tenancy**: Isolated log access for different teams and applications
- **Format Support**: Support various log formats (JSON, syslog, custom formats)
- **Compliance**: Audit trails and compliance reporting capabilities
- **Dashboard**: Real-time dashboards and visualization tools
- **API Access**: RESTful APIs for programmatic access to logs

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime for log ingestion and search
- **Throughput**: Handle 1M+ log events per second
- **Latency**: <1 second from log generation to searchability
- **Storage**: Petabyte-scale log storage with efficient compression
- **Retention**: Support retention periods from days to years
- **Search Performance**: <1 second response time for typical queries

### Key Constraints
- Handle varying log volumes and traffic spikes
