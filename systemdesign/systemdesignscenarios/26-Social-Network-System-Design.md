# Social Network System Design Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary & Requirements

### System Overview
A comprehensive social networking platform that enables users to connect, share content, communicate, and build communities. The system supports user profiles, news feeds, messaging, content sharing, social graphs, and real-time interactions at massive scale similar to Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn.

### Functional Requirements
- **User Management**: Registration, authentication, profiles, and account management
- **Social Graph**: Friend connections, followers, and relationship management
- **News Feed**: Personalized content feeds with algorithmic ranking
- **Content Creation**: Posts, photos, videos, stories, and multimedia sharing
- **Messaging**: Real-time messaging, group chats, and video calls
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for interactions and updates
- **Groups & Communities**: Create and manage interest-based communities
- **Search & Discovery**: Search for users, content, groups, and hashtags
- **Privacy Controls**: Granular privacy settings and content visibility
- **Content Moderation**: Automated and manual content moderation systems

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scale**: 1B+ registered users, 100M+ daily active users
- **Performance**: <200ms for feed loading, <100ms for interactions
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime with global distribution
- **Consistency**: Eventual consistency for feeds, strong for user data
- **Storage**: Petabyte-scale content storage with global distribution
- **Real-time**: <1 second for notifications and messaging

### Key Constraints
- Handle viral content and traffic spikes gracefully
- Maintain user privacy and data protection compliance
- Support multiple content types and media formats
- Scale recommendation algorithms for personalized feeds
- Handle diverse global user base with localization

### Success Metrics
- 99.99% availability during peak usage periods
- <150ms P95 response time for core user interactions
- >80% user engagement with personalized feeds
- <2 seconds average content upload time
- Support 10M+ concurrent active users
