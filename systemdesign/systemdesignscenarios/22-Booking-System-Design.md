# Booking System (Airbnb-style) Design Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary & Requirements

### System Overview
A comprehensive vacation rental and accommodation booking platform that connects property owners (hosts) with travelers (guests), facilitating property listings, search and discovery, booking management, payment processing, and review systems. The platform supports millions of properties worldwide with real-time availability, dynamic pricing, and multi-party coordination.

### Functional Requirements
- **Property Management**: Host property listings with photos, descriptions, amenities, and availability
- **Search & Discovery**: Advanced search with filters, maps, and personalized recommendations
- **Booking Management**: Real-time availability checking, reservation processing, and modifications
- **Payment Processing**: Secure payments with split settlements between platform and hosts
- **User Management**: Host and guest profiles with identity verification and reviews
- **Communication**: Messaging system between hosts and guests
- **Calendar Management**: Real-time availability calendar with pricing rules
- **Review System**: Bidirectional reviews between hosts and guests
- **Dynamic Pricing**: AI-powered pricing recommendations for hosts
- **Multi-language Support**: Global platform with localization

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime for booking and search operations
- **Latency**: <200ms for search results, <1 second for booking confirmation
- **Scale**: 10M+ properties, 100M+ users, 1M+ bookings per day
- **Consistency**: Strong consistency for booking availability and payments
- **Global Reach**: Support for 190+ countries with local regulations
- **Mobile Performance**: Optimized for mobile-first user experience

### Key Constraints
- Handle concurrent booking attempts for the same property
- Manage complex pricing rules and seasonal variations
- Support different property types (entire homes, private rooms, shared spaces)
- Comply with local regulations and tax requirements
- Handle currency conversion and international payments

### Success Metrics
- 99.99% availability during peak booking periods
- <2% booking abandonment rate due to technical issues
- >90% successful payment completion rate
- <5 seconds average property search response time
- Support 50+ languages and currencies
