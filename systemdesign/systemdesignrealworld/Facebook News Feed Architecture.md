### Feed Generation Architecture

**Multi-Stage Content Pipeline Design:**
Facebook's News Feed generation follows a sophisticated multi-stage architecture designed to process massive content volumes while maintaining sub-second response times:

**1. Content Source Aggregation Strategy:**
- **Friends' Posts (Priority 1)**: Recent posts from direct friends within 24-hour window, capped at 3,000 posts to maintain performance
- **Pages Content (Priority 2)**: Posts from followed pages within 48-hour window, allowing slightly older content from brands/creators, limited to 2,000 posts
- **Groups Content (Priority 3)**: Posts from joined groups within 24-hour window, capped at 1,500 posts due to typically higher engagement
- **Trending Content (Priority 4)**: Location and interest-based trending posts, limited to 1,000 items to introduce fresh perspectives
- **ML-Suggested Content (Priority 5)**: Algorithm-recommended content based on user behavior patterns, capped at 1,500 posts
- **Sponsored Content (Priority 6)**: Targeted advertisements based on user profile and behavior, limited to 500 ads per feed generation

**2. Feature Engineering Architecture:**
Facebook employs a comprehensive feature extraction system that processes multiple signal types:

**Content-Based Features:**
- **Basic Metrics**: Content type classification, text length analysis, media presence detection, link analysis
- **Text Analytics**: Natural language processing for sentiment analysis, topic classification, readability scores, and engagement prediction
- **Media Analytics**: Computer vision analysis for image quality, face detection, scene recognition, and video engagement metrics
- **Engagement Signals**: Real-time like counts, comment volumes, share rates, reaction distributions, and engagement velocity calculations

**Author-Based Features:**
- **Relationship Mapping**: Friend vs. page vs. group classification, close friend designation, family relationship identification
- **Authority Metrics**: Follower counts, historical post performance, average engagement rates, content quality scores, spam probability assessment
- **Interaction History**: Historical engagement patterns between user and author, recency of interactions, interaction type distribution

**User-Content Interaction Features:**
- **Direct Interactions**: Previous likes, comments, shares on similar content
- **Social Proof**: Friends' interactions with the same content, network engagement patterns
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Time spent on similar content, scroll behavior, click-through rates

**Temporal Features:**
- **Content Freshness**: Age-based scoring with exponential decay functions, optimal posting time analysis
- **Contextual Timing**: Day-of-week patterns, hour-of-day preferences, seasonal relevance
- **Trend Analysis**: Viral coefficient calculation, engagement acceleration patterns

**3. Machine Learning Ranking System:**

**Model Ensemble Architecture:**
Facebook employs multiple specialized models working in concert:

- **Engagement Prediction Model**: Deep neural networks trained on billions of interaction examples to predict like/comment/share probability
- **Relevance Scoring Model**: Transformer-based models analyzing content-user compatibility using semantic understanding
- **Quality Assessment Model**: Multi-modal models evaluating content quality across text, images, and videos
- **Time-Spent Prediction Model**: Regression models predicting user engagement duration based on content characteristics

**Prediction Fusion Strategy:**
The system combines multiple model outputs using weighted averaging, where weights are dynamically adjusted based on:
- Model confidence scores
- Historical model performance for similar content types
- User segment-specific model effectiveness
- A/B testing results for different weight configurations

**Business Logic Integration:**
Raw ML scores are adjusted using rule-based systems:
- **Freshness Boost**: Recent content receives algorithmic promotion to maintain feed currency
- **Relationship Amplification**: Close friends' content gets significant score increases
- **Quality Promotion**: High-quality content (verified by quality models) receives ranking boosts
- **Spam Penalties**: Content flagged by spam detection systems receives score reductions
- **Social Signal Amplification**: Content with friend interactions receives engagement-based boosts
- **Diversity Balancing**: Similar content types receive diminishing returns to prevent echo chambers

**4. Diversity Optimization System:**

**Multi-Dimensional Diversity Strategy:**
- **Topic Diversity**: Natural language processing categorizes content into topics, ensuring no single topic dominates feeds
- **Author Diversity**: Limits repeated content from same authors while preserving high-quality creators
- **Content Type Diversity**: Balances text posts, images, videos, links, and other media types
- **Temporal Diversity**: Mixes fresh content with slightly older high-quality content
- **Perspective Diversity**: Introduces content from different viewpoints within user's interest areas

**Greedy Selection Algorithm:**
Facebook uses an optimized greedy approach that:
- Iterates through ranked content in score order
- Applies diversity constraints at each selection step
- Maintains quality thresholds while maximizing diversity
- Employs early stopping when diversity targets are met

**5. Caching Architecture:**

**Multi-Level Caching Strategy:**
- **L1 Cache (Redis)**: Recently generated feeds cached for 30 minutes with user-specific keys
- **L2 Cache (Memcached)**: Intermediate computation results cached for feature extraction optimization
- **L3 Cache (CDN)**: Static content elements cached at edge locations for global distribution

**Cache Invalidation Logic:**
- **Time-Based Expiration**: Feeds expire after 15-30 minutes depending on user activity levels
- **Event-Based Invalidation**: User actions (posting, liking, following) trigger selective cache invalidation
- **Predictive Refresh**: High-activity users have feeds pre-generated before expiration

**Performance Optimization Techniques:**
- **Parallel Processing**: Content fetching from multiple sources occurs simultaneously using thread pools
- **Batch Operations**: Feature extraction and ML inference performed in batches for computational efficiency
- **Connection Pooling**: Database connections reused across requests to minimize connection overhead
- **Circuit Breakers**: Failing services bypassed to maintain overall system responsiveness
