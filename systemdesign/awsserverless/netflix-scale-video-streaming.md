# Netflix-Scale Video Streaming: AWS Serverless Architecture

## 1. Business Context & Requirements

Netflix serves over 230 million subscribers worldwide, streaming billions of hours of content monthly across diverse devices and network conditions. The platform must handle massive spikes during popular content releases, maintain sub-second response times for user interactions, and deliver personalized experiences at unprecedented scale.

**Core Requirements:**
- **Scale**: Support 15,000+ concurrent streams per second during peak hours
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime with global content delivery
- **Performance**: <100ms API response times, <3 second video start times
- **Personalization**: Real-time recommendation updates for 230M+ users
- **Content Management**: Handle 15,000+ titles with multi-language support
- **Analytics**: Process 500+ billion events daily for insights and recommendations

**Success Metrics:**
- Stream completion rates >85%
- User engagement time >2 hours daily average
- Content discovery through recommendations >80%
- Global content availability <5 second propagation
- Cost per stream <$0.01 including infrastructure

**Business Constraints:**
- Regulatory compliance across 190+ countries
- Content licensing restrictions by geography
- Variable bandwidth adaptation for mobile users
- Real-time fraud detection and prevention
- Multi-device synchronization across user accounts

The serverless approach enables Netflix to scale elastically while optimizing costs, as compute resources automatically adjust to viewing patterns that vary dramatically by time zone, content popularity, and seasonal events.

## 2. Architecture Overview

Netflix's serverless architecture leverages AWS's managed services to eliminate infrastructure management while achieving massive scale. The system employs event-driven patterns where user actions trigger cascading updates across recommendation engines, analytics pipelines, and content delivery networks.

**Core Architectural Principles:**
- **Microservices Decomposition**: Each business capability (user management, content catalog, recommendations, billing) operates as independent serverless functions
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate through events rather than direct calls, enabling loose coupling and better scalability
- **Data Locality**: User data and content are geographically distributed to minimize latency
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Heavy computations like recommendation model training occur asynchronously without blocking user interactions

**Primary AWS Services:**
- **API Gateway**: Handles 50M+ API calls daily with built-in throttling and caching
- **Lambda**: Processes user interactions, content metadata, and recommendation calculations
- **DynamoDB**: Stores user profiles, viewing history, and real-time recommendations
- **Kinesis**: Streams viewing events, user interactions, and system metrics
- **S3**: Manages content metadata, recommendation models, and analytics data
- **CloudFront**: Delivers content globally with edge caching
- **EventBridge**: Orchestrates complex workflows between microservices

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Read-Heavy Optimization**: Implement aggressive caching strategies since users browse more than they watch
- **Geographic Distribution**: Deploy regional clusters to ensure sub-100ms response times globally
- **Event Sourcing**: Maintain complete audit trails of user interactions for recommendation improvement
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read and write operations for optimal performance at scale

## 3. Detailed Component Design

### API Layer Architecture

The API Gateway serves as the central nervous system, handling authentication, rate limiting, and request routing. Netflix implements a sophisticated multi-tier API strategy:

**Gateway Configuration:**
- **Primary Gateway**: Handles user-facing requests with 10,000 RPS burst capacity
- **Internal Gateway**: Manages service-to-service communication with higher limits
- **Analytics Gateway**: Dedicated endpoint for high-volume event ingestion
- **Admin Gateway**: Secure management interface with strict IP whitelisting

**Security Implementation:**
- JWT tokens with 15-minute expiration for user sessions
- API key validation for service-to-service calls
- WAF integration blocking malicious traffic patterns
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute per user, 10,000/minute per service

**Caching Strategy:**
- Content metadata cached for 5 minutes to balance freshness and performance
- User recommendations cached for 30 minutes with invalidation triggers
- Static assets cached at CloudFront edge locations for 24 hours

### Compute Layer: Lambda Organization

Netflix organizes Lambda functions around business capabilities rather than technical layers:

**User Management Functions:**
- `user-authentication`: Validates credentials and issues JWT tokens
- `user-profile-update`: Handles profile modifications with DynamoDB transactions
- `user-preferences`: Manages viewing preferences and parental controls
- `user-subscription`: Processes billing and subscription changes

**Content Management Functions:**
- `content-catalog-search`: Elasticsearch integration for content discovery
- `content-metadata-update`: Processes new content additions and modifications
- `content-recommendation`: Generates personalized recommendations using ML models
- `content-availability`: Determines content access based on geography and licensing

**Optimization Strategies:**
- **Warm-up Schedule**: Critical functions maintain warm containers during peak hours
- **Memory Allocation**: User-facing functions use 512MB for sub-100ms response times
- **Concurrency Limits**: Set to 10,000 per function to prevent downstream service overload
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Capture failed requests for retry and debugging

### Data Layer: Multi-Model Approach

**DynamoDB Design Patterns:**

*User Profiles Table:*
```
Partition Key: user_id
Sort Key: profile_type (main|preferences|viewing_history)
Attributes: profile_data (JSON), last_updated, geographic_region
GSI: geographic_region for regional analytics
```

*Content Catalog Table:*
```
Partition Key: content_id  
Sort Key: content_version
Attributes: title, description, metadata, availability_regions
GSI: genre + release_date for browse functionality
LSI: content_type for filtering
```

*Recommendations Table:*
```
Partition Key: user_id
Sort Key: recommendation_type + timestamp
Attributes: content_ids (list), confidence_scores, expiration_time
TTL: 24 hours for automatic cleanup
```

**Aurora Serverless for Analytics:**
